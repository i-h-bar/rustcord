## Features

- **Card search** via `/search` or inline `[[card name]]` syntax in any message
- **Fuzzy matching** — slight misspellings are forgiven
- **Scoped search** by set name, set code, or artist
- **Printings dropdown** — browse every printing of a card with set symbols
- **Similar cards dropdown** — surfaces close matches if the wrong card was returned
- **Guessing game** with three difficulty levels and progressive clue reveals

---

## Card Search

Use the `/search` command or wrap a card name in double square brackets anywhere in a message:

```
[[lightning bolt]]
```

Refine by set or artist:

```
[[lightning bolt | set=m11]]
[[relentless rats | artist=thomas m baxa]]
[[gitrog monster | set=shadows over innistrad]]
```

You can use inline queries mid-sentence and stack multiple in one message:

```
I really love [[the gitrog monster | set=bloomburrow commander]], the classic [[gitrog monster | set=soi]] is not as cool.
```

Results include a **Select a print** dropdown to browse alternate printings and a **Similar cards** dropdown to navigate to related cards.

## Guessing Game

Start a game with `/play`. Options:
- **Set** — limit the mystery card to a specific set
- **Difficulty** — Easy (8 guesses), Medium (6 guesses, default), Hard (4 guesses)

The bot progressively reveals clues — mana cost, type line, rules text, and eventually a cropped illustration. Submit guesses with `/guess` (fuzzy matching applies). Give up with `/give_up` to reveal the answer.
