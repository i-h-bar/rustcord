## Usage:
To search a card simple put your desired card in double square brackets: `[[lightning bolt]]`
Don't worry about slight misspellings as the bot with try and find the best match for what you have put    

To refine your search you can specify artist/set (both set abbreviation and full name): `[[lightning bolt | set=m11]]` or `[[relentless rats | artist = thomas m baxa]]  
These can be combined in one query.  

Additionally, you can put this mid-sentence as to not break your flow, as well as multiple in one message. For example:  
`I really love the artwork of [[the gitrog monster | set=bloomburrow commander]] it shows his true chonk, the classic [[gitrog monster | set=soi]] is not as cool.`
